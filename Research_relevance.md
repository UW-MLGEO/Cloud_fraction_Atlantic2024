The goal of this project was intially to use cloud images using specific cloud properties, like cloud optical depth and cloud short wave radiation from the GOES-2 satellite, strictly over California,  to write a convolutional neural network (CNN). This neural network would then try to identify the cloud type, given these properties and images. This would have required manually labeling large quantities of cloud images by hand. We have since discovered the time constraint of this and pivoted to a different end goal. Instead, we will increase the number of cloud variables pulled from the GOES-2 satellite, input some meterological variables at 0.25 x 0.25 resolution from ERA-5 reanalysis datasets and perform unsupervised classification. The unsupervised classification will determine either precipitation or cloud fraction given the different GOES-2 variables constrained by the meterological variables from ERA-5. Additionally, we will try to attempt a principal component analysis to determine which components are most significant in contributing to precipitation or cloud fraction. Furthermore, we will shift the location to open ocean to remove predicted topographical issues. 

Rather than predicting explicit cloud types (as initially planned), we aim to uncover patterns in the data to distinguish precipitation-related conditions or classify areas by cloud fraction levels. By clustering data without predefined labels, we capture natural groupings that could indicate underlying weather patterns associated with cloud formation and precipitation. Unsupervised classification is ideal for this because it allows the model to automatically group data based on similarities in cloud variables without relying on hand-labeled images. It will aid us in revealing intrinsic relationships in a large, multidimensional dataset where labeling is arduous.

The expected outcome of this project is a model that can classify conditions indicative of precipitation or varying cloud fractions over open ocean. We anticipate that a principal component analysis will identify the most influential variables, guiding us in understanding which cloud and meteorological features contribute significantly to precipitation and cloud fraction. If applied to future atmospheric and climate research, this model used in tandem with this dataset, could potentially offer insights for weather prediction, climate trend analysis, and improved understanding of cloud behavior in relation to precipitation.
